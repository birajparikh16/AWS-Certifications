## Machine Learning Lifecycle

Process Data:
    * Features and labels
    * Feature engineering
    * Feature reduction
    * Encoding
    * Formatting (RecordIO)

Split Data: Train, Validation, Test

Deploy:
    * Host model in execution environment according to the requirements.
    * Batch. You have a more that is not labelled and you want to label it over the data. For example you have a whole list of medical records of heart disease that are not labelled and apply batch process using model to label if they are susceptible to the heart disease, using appropriate infrastructure.
    * As a service. Like an web application end point that an application can use. It can send individual records into the service and have individual prediction being made. Example: Mobile app for hot dog or not. 
    * Infrastructure (eg. load balancing)
