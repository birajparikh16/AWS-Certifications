## 2. Setting up a billing alarm

Creating a billing alarm sends an email message to the user when the estimated charges for AWS exceeds a specified threshold. Steps to create a billing alarm:

### Enable Billing Alert

1) Log-in to the AWS account either as a root user or an IAM user, whose access to the Billing and Cost Management console has been activated.
2) If necessary, change the Region to US East (N. Virginia). Billing metric data is stored in this Region and represents worldwide charges. This data includes the estimated charges for every service in AWS that you use, as well as the estimated overall total of your AWS charges.
3) On the top right corner of the console, click on the account name and select 'My Billing Dashboard' which will take you to the billing console where we will set up the billing alarm.
4) Select 'Billing Preferences' under 'Preferences', on left side of the navigation bar. You will see few check boxes:

    i) Select 'Receive Billing alerts'.

    ii) Select 'Free tier usage alerts' and enter email address associated with the AWS account.

    iii) Select 'Receive PDF Invoice By Email' to receive a PDF version of the invoice via email. This step is optional.

5) Click 'Save Preferences' and the changes you made on this page will be committed to your account.

## 3. Adding MFA to the account root user

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an authentication method in which a computer user is granted access only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an authentication mechanism: Password set up by the user and one time password generated by the MFA app on user device like phone etc. Examples of MFA are:
