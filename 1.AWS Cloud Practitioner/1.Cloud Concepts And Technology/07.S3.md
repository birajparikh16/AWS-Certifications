# S3 (Simple Storage Service)

S3 provides secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage. Its an online, bulk storage that anyone can access from any device. It is object based-storage which is used to store files anywhere from 0 bytes to 5TB, opposite to block storage(you install OS where you will install a database server).
The data is spread across multiple devices and multiple facilities.
The storage is unlimited and files are stored in buckets.
Files uploaded in S3 can be from 0 bytes to 5 TB.

## Basics

S3 is a universal namespace meaning the bucket name is unique globally.

When you upload a file successfully, you will receive HTTP 200.

S3 is object based that consists of key i.e. file name and value i.e. data made up of bytes.

Version ID when you upload same file multiple times.

Metadata and Subresources (Access Control List and Torrent)

## Data Consistency model for S3 (IMP for exam)

1. Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects.

If you put a new file in S3, you will be immediately able to read it from S3.

2. Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take sometime to propagate).

If you upload a newer version of the existing file, you might read the older version of the file when try to read it. Similarly, you might be able to access the file from S3 bucket for sometime after deleting. It takes some time for changes to come in affect. Eventual consistency for overwrites PUTS and DELETES.

## S3 service gurantees

1. Built for 99.99% availability for S3 platform.
2. Amazon guarantees 99.9% availability and 99.999999999% (11x9s)durability.

## S3 Features

1. Tiered Storage
2. Lifecycle Management
3. Versioning
4. Encryption
5. Secure data using ACL(Access Control List its on file level) and Bucket Policies(its on bucket level).
