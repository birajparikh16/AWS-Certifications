# EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute)

EC2 is a virtual server in the cloud. Using EC2 in Amazon cloud eliminates the need to invest in hardware upfront, so you can develop and deploy applications faster.

## Different EC2 Pricing Models

1. On Demand
Allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by second) with no commitment.
Use case:
    a. Low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment.
    b. Applications with short tem, spiky or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
    c. Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time.

2. Reserved
Provides with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for the instance. Contract terms are 1-3 years. The longer the contract the more discount you will get.
Use cases:
    a. Applications with steady state or predictable usage.
    b. Applications that require reserved capacity.
    c. Users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further.
Different Reserved Pricing Types:
1. Standard Reserved Instances: These offer upto 75% off on demand instances. The more you pay up front and the longer the contract, the greater the discount. <b>You can't change between instance family eg. you can't change from high performance memory over high performance compute.</b>
2. Convertible Reserved Instances: These offer upto 54% off on demand capacity to change the attributes of the RI as long as the exchange results in the creation of Reserved Instances of equal or greater value. <b>You can between the instances family as long as you are changing to equal or greater value.</b>
3. Scheduled Reserved Instances: These are available to launch within the time windows you reserved. This option allows you to match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day, a week or a month. <b>For scheduled workload.</b>

3. Spot
Enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even  greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.
Use cases:
    a. Applications that have flexible start and end times.
    b. Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices.
    c. Users with urgent computing needs for large amount of additional capacity.

4. Dedicated Hosts
Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.
Use cases:
    a. Useful for regulatory requirements that many not support multi-tenant virtualization. For example you work for a government department that has a low to use dedicated hosts.
    b. Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments. eg. Oracle or Microsoft or VMware licensing etc.
    c. Can be purchased On-demand(hourly).
    d. Can be purchased as a Reservation for upto 70% off on the On-demand price.
